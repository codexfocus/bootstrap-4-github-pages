Code test here. A quick test to see what will show on the excerpt. I think it will show until a return.

This will not show.

```
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb);Database=DatabaseNameHere;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
  }
```


The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
